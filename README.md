# 🖥️ Java Mini Projects
This repository contains a collection of small Java programs created to practice OOP concepts, control structures, and basic algorithms.
Each file focuses on different fundamental aspects of Java programming.

## 📁 Project List

### 1. 👋🌍 Helloworld
A simple program that prints a greeting message to the console.

**Concepts:** System.out.println, basic syntax

### 2. 🧮 Calculator
A basic calculator that takes user input and performs arithmetic operations such as addition, substraction, multiplication, and division.

**Concepts:** Scanner, if-else, arithmetic operations, user interaction.

### 3. 👤 PersonDemo
This projects demonstrates **inheritance**  with the classes 'Person', 'Student', and 'Teacher'. It shows how to call superclass constructors using 'super()' and how to create instances of different subclasses.

**Concepts:** classes, inheritance, constructors


### 4. 🦌🦁🐟️ PredatorPreyDemo
A simple model with interfaces and polymorphism:

- 'Prey' and 'Predator' interfaces
- 'Gazelle' implements 'Prey'
- 'Lion' implements 'Predator'
- 'Fish' implements 'Prey' and 'Predator'
- Demonstrates how different objects bevave using the same methods ('hunt', 'run');

**Concepts:**interfaces, polymorphism, overriding method.

### 5. 🎅🎁 SantaSleigh
A mini project that models Santa's sleigh and the gifts to be delivered around the world.

- 'Gift' class
- 'Country' enum
- 'Santasleigh'  class with methods to add, deliver, and list gifts

**Concepts:** OOP, collections ('LinkedList'), enums, search and remove operations.

### 6. 🧑🏻‍🎓 Student 
A small class representing a students with basic attributes and methods. It can be used as a starting point for larger projects such as student management system.

**Concepts:** encapsulation, constructors. getters/setters.

### 7. 🚗 VehicleDemo
An example using **abstract classes**:

- 'Vehicle' is an abstract class with abstract methods 'move()' and 'brake()'.
- 'Car' extends 'Vehicle' and provides concrete implementations.

**Concepts:** abstraction, inheritance, overriding method.

## 📌 How to run
Each file contains its own 'main' method
