# 🖥️ Java Mini Projects
This repository contains a collection of small Java programs created to practice OOP concepts, control structures, and basic algorithms.
Each file focuses on different fundamental aspects of Java programming.

## 📁 Project List

### 1. 👋🌍 Helloworld
A simple program that prints a greeting message to the console.

**Concepts:** System.out.println, basic syntax

### 2. 🧮 Calculator
A basic calculator that takes user input and performs arithmetic operations such as addition, substraction, multiplication, and division.

**Concepts:** Scanner, if-else, arithmetic operations, user interaction.

### 3. 👤 PersonDemo
This projects demonstrates **inheritance**  with the classes 'Person', 'Student', and 'Teacher'. It shows how to call superclass constructors using 'super()' and how to create instances of different subclasses.

**Concepts:** classes, inheritance, constructors


### 4. 🦌🦁🐟️ PredatorPreyDemo
A simple model with interfaces and polymorphism:

- 'Prey' and 'Predator' interfaces
- 'Gazelle' implements 'Prey'
- 'Lion' implements 'Predator'
- 'Fish' implements 'Prey' and 'Predator'
- Demonstrates how different objects bevave using the same methods ('hunt', 'run');

**Concepts:** interfaces, polymorphism, overriding method.

### 5. 🧙‍♂️ HarryPotter Duel Simulator  
A simple Harry Potter-themed program simulating a magical duel between two wizards.

- `Wizard` class with attributes like name, house, health, and magic power.  
- `Spell` class representing spells with names and damage values.  
- Wizards cast spells on each other, reducing health based on magic power and spell damage.  
- Simulates one round of duel with output showing spell casts, damage, and health status.  
- Determines and prints the winner or if the duel is a tie.

**Concepts:** classes, enums, object interaction, basic OOP, method calls, console output.



### 6. 🧑🏻‍🎓 Student 
A small class representing a students with basic attributes and methods. It can be used as a starting point for larger projects such as student management system.

**Concepts:** encapsulation, constructors. getters/setters.

### 7. 🚗 VehicleDemo
An example using **abstract classes**:

- 'Vehicle' is an abstract class with abstract methods 'move()' and 'brake()'.
- 'Car' extends 'Vehicle' and provides concrete implementations.

**Concepts:** abstraction, inheritance, overriding method.

### 10. 🕵️‍♂️ Detective Case Management System  
A system to manage detective cases within a crime agency.

- `Case` class models a case with ID, title, description, status, and suspects list.  
- `Detective` class represents detectives with unique IDs and assigned cases.  
- `Agency` class manages collections of cases and detectives, with methods to add cases/detectives, assign cases, close cases, and query cases by status or detective.

**Concepts:** OOP, enums, collections, object relationships, uniqueness checks, filtering.
